            <p>Tasos is among the few designers who arrogantly support the idea that web (design) is still <a href="https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period" target="_blank" title="">95% typography</a>. Having a strong graphic design and typographic background, he has worked as art director, type designer and UI engineer with a career path of over <%= "#{(Date.today.year - 2001)}" %> years.</p>
            <p>Today, he designs interfaces and quite often writes presentational code for the web. He cares a lot about user experience, reusability, functionalism and minimal yet meaningful design. He favours semantically structured markup, thoroughly orchestrated CSS and component-based development.</p>
            <p>Throughout his professional endeavours, Tasos has <dfn class="sample__anchor">crafted <span class="sample__item"></span></dfn><dfn class="sample__anchor">typefaces, <span class="sample__item"></span></dfn><dfn class="sample__anchor">logotypes, <span class="sample__item sample__item--portrait"></span></dfn>illustrations, <dfn class="sample__anchor">web <span class="sample__item"></span></dfn>interfaces, <dfn class="sample__anchor">digital <span class="sample__item"></span></dfn><dfn class="sample__anchor">experiences <span class="sample__item"></span></dfn> and <dfn class="sample__anchor">more<span class="sample__item"></span></dfn>.</p>
            <p>Currently he designs demanding web applications with a group of briliant folks at PeoplePerHour.</p>
