            <p><span>Teyepe</span> is the moniker of multi&shy;disciplinary product designer <span>Tasos Dervenagas</span>.</p>
            <p>He builds honest yet functional user interfaces and develops meticulous design systems. Tasos is a design lead at <span>PeoplePerHour</span>.</p>

            <p>Tasos is among the few designers who arrogantly support the idea that web (design) is still <a class="c-link--txt" href="https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period" target="_blank" title="">95% typography</a>. Having a strong graphic design and typographic background, he has worked as art director, type designer and UI engineer with a career path of over <%= "#{(Date.today.year - 2001)}" %> years.</p>
            <p>Today, he designs interfaces and quite often writes presentational code for the web. He cares a lot about user experience, reusability, functionalism and minimal yet meaningful design. He favours semantically structured markup, thoroughly orchestrated CSS and component-based development.</p>
            <p>Currently he designs demanding web applications with a group of briliant folks at PeoplePerHour.</p>
