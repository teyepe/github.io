#### Who this thing is for 🤔

This repo is actually just for... myself. It's crafted with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io). Since it's meant to be a servitude to my own representation, it's likely useless for you! Nevertheless, since it's hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), it's open source, meaning that you can fork, explore, suggest improvements (especially if you are a JS aficionado), and steal whatever makes sense to you —for the greater good.

#### Important notice ⚖️
This repository contains DJR fonts that are licensed to [Tasos Dervenagas](https://teyepe.com). You can read the full text of the license in the /type directory. You must obtain an appropriate license at <https://djr.com> before using these font files yourself. Finally, you cannot use these, or any other fonts to promote hate speech.
